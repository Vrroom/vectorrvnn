The hierarchy generated from the grouping procedure can make it easy to select individual paths in Vector Graphics. Instead of clicking on each path individually you can instead select a node in the hierarchy. 

## Installation

* First build the front end:
```
cd client
npm run build
```
* Launch the backend:
```

```
